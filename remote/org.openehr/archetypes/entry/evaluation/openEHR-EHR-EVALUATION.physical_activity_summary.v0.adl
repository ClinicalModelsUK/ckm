Please note: There is some apparent overlap between the 'Physical activity level (PAL) status' data element in this archetype and the 'Physical activity category' data element in OBSERVATION.physical_activity archetype - they both use the same value set. Use this archetype when recording the the typical activity as a summative statement, however if the intent is to record the category at a specified point in time or during a specified period of time then use the equivalent data point in the OBSERVATION.physical_activity.">
