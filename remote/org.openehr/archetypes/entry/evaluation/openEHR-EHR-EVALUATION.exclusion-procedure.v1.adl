			purpose = <"To positively record statement/s about procedures that need to be clinically excluded from the health record at a specific point in time.">
			use = <"Use to record positive statement/s about the absence or exclusion of procedures performed within the health record at a specific point in time. For example: to record that the patient has not had any operations or significant procedures; or that the patient has not had an appendicectomy, if presenting with abdominal pain.

This archetype has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any procedures performed within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: exclusion of appendicectomy during a consultation or emergency room visit for abdominal pain is only relevant at the time of recording and is effectively obsolete if the subsequent diagnosis is appendicitis and an appendicectomy performed.">
