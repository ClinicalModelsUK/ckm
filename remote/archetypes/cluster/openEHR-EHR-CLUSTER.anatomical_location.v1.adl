This archetype is designed to be used within the context of other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes and solely to provide a structured and consistent way to represent identified body sites. It also carries a SLOT which allows for inclusion of other more complex body locations, such as CLUSTER.relative_location or CLUSTER.precise_location, if these are required in addition.

In practice, some archetypes carry a single data element for carrying a simple description of body site - for example, OBSERVATION.blood_pressure and CLUSTER.symptom when describing ear pain. In this situation, where the value set is predictable and simple to define, this is a very accurate and pragmatic way to record the site in the body and to query at a later date.

However in the situation where the anatomical location is not well defined or needs to be determined at run-time, it may be more flexible to use this archetype. For example, in the situation where any symptom can be recorded without any predefined scope of the type of symptom, then allowing the use of this archetype to specifically define an anatomical location in the body may be useful. In this case the CLUSTER.symptom archetype also carries a SLOT for 'Complex Body Location' which can hold both this archetype plus the CLUSTER.relative_location to support maximal flexibility.

In the situation where this archetype can only be used to name a large and/or non-specific body part, the additional use of the CLUSTER.relative_location archetype in the 'Complex Location' SLOT will support recording of a more precise location - for example, 2 cm anterior to the cubital fossa of the left forearm or 4 cm below R costal margin on the chest wall in the mid-clavicular line.

If this archetype is used within other archetypes where the clinical context or specified subject of care is not the individual for whom the record is being created - the key example being a fetus in-utero - then in that situation the anatomical location will be identifying a body site appropriate to the specified context or on/within the specified subject of care.">
