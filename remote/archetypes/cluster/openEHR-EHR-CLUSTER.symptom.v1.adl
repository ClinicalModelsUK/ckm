			use = <"Use to record detail about a single symptom as reported by an individual, parent, care-giver or other party.  It may be recorded by a clinician as part of a clinical history record as reported to them, or self-recorded as part of a clinical questionnaire or personal health record. 

This archetype has been designed as a generic framework for all symptoms. 

It is intended to be inserted into the 'Details' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype or in any other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype requiring capture of symptom-related data. It can also be reused by inserting it within other CLUSTER.symptom archetypes - within either the context of the 'Associated symptoms' SLOT or 'Previous details' SLOT. The specific symptom will be identified by the value for the 'Symptom name' data element, preferably from a selected terminology where available.

The use of 'Not present' in clinical data recording reflects an efficient way for clinicians to explicitly record that a symptom is not causing the patient any discomfort or disturbance, usually without any necessary qualifers or reasons. The possibility of modelling of 'Not present' as an a separate exclusion CLUSTER or ELEMENT archetype within the Symptom archetype, in the same way as 'No examination done' has been modelled within examination CLUSTER archetypes, has been deliberately avoided because of additional, unwarranted overheads to model maintenance, implementation and querying. For these pragmatic reasons 'Not present' has been included as an explicit data element in this Symptom archetype. 

Specific data elements that are uniquely and additionally required for the identified symptom can be included as a separate CLUSTER archetype inserted into the 'Specific Details' SLOT. For example, those required to record details about pain.

Some data elements will have values sets that are in common with all symptoms, for example Severity values as Mild, Moderate and Severe. Others, such as 'Impact' will require unique value sets that are relevant to the identified symptom, for example the functional impacts of hearing loss will be significantly different to pain.">
