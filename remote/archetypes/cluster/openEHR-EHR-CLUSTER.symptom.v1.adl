A complete patient history may include varying level of details about a multiple symptoms.">
			use = <"Use to record detailed information about a single symptom.

This archetype has been designed as a generic framework for all symptoms. 

It is intended to be inserted into the 'Details' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype or in any other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype requiring capture of symptom-related data. It can also be reused by inserting it within other CLUSTER.symptom archetypes - within either the context of the 'Associated symptoms' SLOT or 'Previous details' SLOT. The specific symptom will be identified by the value for the 'Symptom name' data element, preferably from a selected terminology where available.

Specific data elements that are uniquely and additionally required for the identified symptom can be included as a separate CLUSTER archetype inserted into the 'Specific Details' SLOT. For example, those required to record details about pain.

Some data elements will have values sets that are in common with all symptoms, for example Severity values as Mild, Moderate and Severe. Others, such as 'Impact' will require unique value sets that are relevant to the identified symptom, for example the functional impacts of hearing loss will be significantly different to pain.

The 'nil significant' data element reflects way to record a shorthand commonly used by clinicians who need to require that a symptom is not causing the patient any discomfort or disturbance. It is similar in nature to an exclusion statement but rather reflects that the physiological state of the patient is normal rather than excluding a specific clinical manifestation. Modelling of 'nil significant' as an explicit exclusion statement in the same way as 'No examination done' within examination CLUSTER archetypes has been deliberately avoided. As 'Nil Significant' is a commonly used attribute and usually recorded without any qualifier or reason, it is considered that using a separate CLUSTER or ELEMENT archetype in all relevant use cases will result in unjustifiable modelling overheads. It has been included as an explicit data element in the Symptom archetype for these pragmatic reasons. In contrast, only in relatively uncommon clinical situations will 'No Examination Done' need to be explictly recorded, yet the ability to record it unambiguously in situations such as examinations for medicolegal purposes will be important, usually alongside the reason why examination findings were not recorded.">
