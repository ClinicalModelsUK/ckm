This archetype is designed to be included in Status SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype.

These status qualifiers should be used with care as they are variably applied in practice and interoperability cannot be assured unless usage guidelines are clearly defined within the clinical community in which the 'Problem/Diagnosis' and 'Problem status' archetype pair may be shared.

The 'Unspecified' data element has been added to support addition of other qualifiers that might only be used locally or where the use case has not been clearly established at the time of this archetype being published. As other qualifiers are identified they can be added to this archetype as a backwardly compatible revision.">
