This archetype has been specifically designed to make a clear and unambiguous statement of exclusion of any clinical item within the health record. This approach is used in preference to relying on flags or terminology to express negation.

Specialisations of this archetype have been developed to capture specific and more detailed information about common exclusions, such as problems or diagnoses. 

Please note that exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the point-in-time of recording. It is possible for a record to be able to state that an individual has NO KNOWN history of XYZ (using an exclusion statement) at the same time as recording the evidence of their first experience of XYZ (using the corresponding archetype that records the first experience eg via an EVALUATION for a diagnosis or adverse reaction). In future record statements, the individual may subsequently have a KNOWN history of XYZ recorded in their problem list.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion of adverse reactions - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-adverse_reaction archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion  of medication use - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-medication archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of procedures - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-procedure archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of problems or diagnoses - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-problem_diagnosis archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of family history - use the EVALUATION.exclusion-family_history archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of any component of physical examination - use the CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetype.">
