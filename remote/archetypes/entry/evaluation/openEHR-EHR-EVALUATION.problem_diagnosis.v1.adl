			purpose = <"For recording summary details about any identified health problem or diagnosis. 

The intended scope of a health problem is deliberately kept loose in the context of clinical documentation, so as to capture any real or perceived concerns that may adversely affect an individual's wellbeing to any degree. A health problem may be identified by the individual, a carer or a healthcare professional. However, a diagnosis is additionally defined based on scientific evaluation of clinical evidence, and usually determined only by a healthcare professional.">
			use = <"Use for recording summary details about any identified health-related problem or diagnosis. 

Clear definitions that enable differentiation between a 'problem' versus a 'diagnosis' is almost impossible in practice - we cannot reliably tell when a problem should be regarded as a diagnosis. When diagnostic criteria are successfully met, then clearly we can confidently call the condition a formal diagnosis, but prior to these conditions being met and while there are supportive evidence available, it can also be valid to call it a diagnosis. The amount of supportive evidence required for the label of diagnosis is not easy to define and in reality probably varies from condition to condition. Many standards committees have grappled with this definitional conundrum for years without clear resolution.

For the purposes of clinical documentation with this archetype, problem and diagnosis are regarded as a continuum, with increasing levels of detail and supportive evidence usually providing weight towards the label of 'diagnosis'. In this archetype it is not neccessary to classify the condition as a 'problem' or 'diagnosis'. The data structure to support documentation of either are identical, with additional data structure provided to support inclusion of the evidence if and when it becomes available. Examples of problems include: the individual's expressed desire to lose weight, but without a formal diagnosis of Obesity; or a relationship problem with family member. Examples of formal diagnoses would include a cancer that is supported by historical information, examination findings, histological findings, radiological findings and meets all requirements for known diagnostic criteria. In practice, most problems or diagnoses do not sit at either end of the problem-diagnosis spectrum, but somewhere in between.

This archetype can be used within many contexts. For example, recording a problem or a clinical diagnosis during a clinical consultation; populating a persistent Problem List; or to provide a summary statement within a Discharge Summary document.

In practice, clinicians use many context-specific qualifiers such as past/present, primary/secondary, active/inactive, admission/discharge etc. The contexts can be location-, specialisation-, episode- or workflow-specific, and these can cause confusion or even potential safety issues if perpetuated in Problem Lists or shared in documents that are outside of the original context. These qualifiers can be archetyped separately and included in the ‘Status’ slot, because their use varies in different settings. It is expected that these will be used mostly within the appropriate context and not shared out of that context without clear understanding of potential consequences. For example, a primary diagnosis to one clinician may be a secondary one to another specialist; an active problem can become inactive (or vice versa) and this can impact the safe use of clinical decision support. In general these qualifiers should be applied locally within the context of the clinical system, and in practice these statuses should be manually curated by clinicians to ensure that lists of Current/Past, Active/Inactive or Primary/Secondary Problems are clinically accurate. 

This archetype will be used as a component within the Problem Oriented Medical Record as described by Larry Weed. Additional archetypes, representing clinical concepts such as condition as an overarching orgnaniser for diagnoses etc, will need to be developed to support this approach.

In some situations, it may be assumed that identification of a diagnosis fits solely within the medical domain, but this is not the intent for this archetype. Diagnoses can be recorded by any other healthcare professionals using this archetype within the defined scope of the archetype.">
			keywords = <"issue", "condition", "problem", "obstacle", "diagnosis", "concern">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record symptoms as described by the individual - use the CLUSTER.symptom archetype, usually within the OBSERVATION.story archetype.

Not to be used to record examination findings - use the family of examination-related CLUSTER archetypes, usually nested within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype.

Not to be used to record test results - use an appropriate archetype from the pathology, imaging or similar OBSERVATION archetypes.

Not to be used to record 'Differential Diagnoses' - use the EVALUATION.differential_diagnosis archetype.

Not to be used to record 'Reason for Encounter' or 'Presenting Complaint' - use the EVALUATION.reason_for_encounter archetype.

Not to be used to record procedures - use the ACTION.Procedure archetype.

Not to be used to record details about pregnancy - use the EVALUATION.pregnancy_bf_status and EVALUATION.pregnancy and related archetypes.

Not to be used to record statements about health risk or potential problems - use the EVALUATION.risk archetype.

Some clinical specialists make diagnoses that are focused on the context of their domain alone. For example, a pathological diagnosis based only on histopathological examination of tissue. This archetype is not intended to capture a domain-specific diagnosis but to consider a pathological diagnosis as one of multiple inputs to the consideration of a clinical diagnosis that will be recorded using this archetype. Domain-specific diagnoses should be recorded in archetypes that are specific for this purpose - for example the 'Pathological diagnosis' data element within the Histopathology OBSERVATION archetype.">
