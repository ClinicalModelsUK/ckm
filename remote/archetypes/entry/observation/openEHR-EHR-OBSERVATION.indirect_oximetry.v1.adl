			purpose = <"To record indirect, currently non-invasive, blood gas measurements, such as Spo2 and pTCO2, via pulse oximetry, transcutaneous oximetry or other methods.

It is likely that this archetype will be used primarily to record oxygenation estimations, but other gas measurements may be included, or added over time.">
			use = <"Used to record indirect blood gas measurement, currently by non-invasive techniques. New indirect blood gas measurements should be added to this archetype.

Where the recording device also provides another type of measurement, such as pulse rate, this should be recorded in a separate archetype, appropriate for that particular measurement to allow consistent querying. In this example, record the pulse rate in the OBSERVATION.pulse archetype. 

The aim is to consistently model a clinical concept, rather than to model device output ; devices are increasingly multi-functional and provide overlapping measurements which may need to be recorded using a number of discrete archetypes.

Waveforms should be recorded here when used to document quality of the blood gas measurement. In contrast, if used for primary diagnostic purposes e.g. of cardiac output, plesmythography should be recorded in the key associated clinical archetype - OBSERVATION.pulse.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record any peripheral blood gas measurement that involves direct contact with blood. For example, PaO2, PaCO2 should be recorded using the OBSERVATION.pathology_test archetype suitable for recording blood gases.

Not to be used to record invasive blood gas measurement. For example, arterial (SaO2), venous (SvO2) oxygen saturation or Oxygen content (CaOC) which are usually determined by invasive methods such as laboratory blood gases or vascular catheter devices. These should also be recorded within the OBSERVATION.lab_test-blood_gases archetype.">
