			purpose = <"To record the results of intraocular pressure of an individual, normally using a tonometry device.">
			use = <"Use to record the results of measurement of intraocular pressure of a single eye.  It is common  for different toniometry methods to be required for each eye because of patient intolerance. This precludes recording the results from both eyes within the same Entry record i.e. each eye will need a separate instance of the archetype to record the result for each eye.

The 'Clinical Description' data element can be used to record simple narrative summary or as a means to integrate legacy data. 

Detailed, structured intraocular pressure results are preferred.

The 'Absent Test Result' element may be used to record circumstances where a test could not be performed or completed. Further details may be recorded under 'Confounding Factors' or 'Additional Comment'.">
