			use = <"*Use to record clinical observations regarding the reponsiveness of an adult subject to stimuli. It is commonly used to establish a baseline conscious state and neurological function assessment and/or to detect patients who may require immediate medical intervention.

In practical use, Glasgow Coma Scale is frequently calculated as a monitoring variable, using sequential and repeated measurements. Date and time should be recorded for each measurement, as well as any factors that may influence interpretation of changes. Changes in Total score or any E, M or V values may have as much clinical significance as the value recorded initially.

The Total Score can be derived as the sum of the recorded eye, motor and verbal response scores. 

The EMV Score can be derived as a concatenation of each of the recorded eye, motor and verbal response scores. For example, E3 M2 V4 represents the conscious state of a subject who opens eyes to speech, has an extensor response to pain and utters incomprehensible sounds.

The three response values are considered separately as well as their sum. 

The minimum possible Total Score value is 3 (equivalent to E1 M1 V1) and the maximum possible is 15 (equivalent to E4 M6 V5).

A recorded response for each of E, M and V is mandatory. If a response cannot be determined at all, then use of \"Not Applicable\" as a null flavour is appropriate to record. If any one of the eye, motor or verbal responses cannot be assessed - for example if the subject is intubated and not able to respond verbally, or paralysed and not able to provide a motor response - the score recorded for the response is 1 and a modifier attached. If the subject is intubated the verbal response component can be represented as V1t, where t = tube, or V1Intubated. If the subject has severe facial/eye swelling or injuries and can't open their eyes, the eye response component can be represented as E1c, where c=closed. Sometimes the numeric one may be omitted, in which case the eye response component might be expressed as Ec - for example, Ec M2 V4. The reason for not being able to assess a response can be recorded in the 'Comment' data element.

Clinical decision support should be based upon each of the specific records of eye, motor and verbal responses and the explicit statements that a response cannot be assessed, rather than the derived and composite EMV Score.(en)">
