			use = <"Use as a generic procedure-related archetype to carry information about any stand-alone procedure or operation performed. 

It is anticipated that each COMPOSITION.report-procedure archetype will contain at least a ACTION.procedure (or related archetype) but depending on the complexity of the procedure it may contain a variety of other archetypes depending on the nature and complexity of the procedure performed. For example, archetypes to describe the associated anaesthetic or imaging activities carried out during the procedure.

Common use cases are: 
- any procedure that is not recorded as part of a consultation but needs to be carried out recorded as a stand-alone activity; 
- Endoscopy Report; through to a 
- complete Operation Report for an appendicectomy or joint replacement.

The Sections component has been deliberately left unconstrained to maximise re-use of this archetype.">

Not to be used for procedures that are recorded as part of a nursing progress note, for example insertion of a catheter - use an ACTION.procedure archetype inside the COMPOSITION.progress_note.">
