			purpose = <"The Medication Item Cluster records details of a medication, dosage, administration and dispensing instructions. 
The model is closely aligned with the SCI-XML, dm+d, RCP medication record guidance, HSCIC Dose syntax and GP2GP medication models. It is intended to support both ‘product-based’ prescribing, used in community and most out-patient settings; and ‘dose-based’ prescribing , generally used in in-patient settings.
e.g.
 Product-based prescribing “Citalopram tab 20mg, 1 tab daily”,
 Dose-based prescribing  ”Citalopram, oral, 20 mg once daily”.

The archetype may be used to record core details of a medication order, medication action or medication item summary e.g in an unscheduled care summary (KIS, SCR, IHR), referral or discharge letter, or to underpin an API call which returns a medication summary.

The archetype may also be used to record discrete medication 'events', the normal approach within an individual application or shared medication record, where each phase of oredering or supplying the medication is stored as separate record.

The differences between hospital 'dose-based' prescribing and ambulatory 'product-based' prescribing, currently limit the degree to which the medication record can be made interoperable across care settings, particularly because of the potential complexity of dosage instructions.

For clinical safety reasons, fully automated information exchange at transitions of care, without human oversight,  is probably undesirable, and in spite of the limitations, the use of a common, structured medication record, will add substantial benefit.">
			use = <"This archetype will always be used within the context of a parent Entry archetype, such as 'Medication Order' or 'Medication Action' and is designed for outpatient and ambulatory care settings. It may also be used at transitions of care to facilitate medicines reconciliation.

Use of the archetype will vary depending on the care setting responsible ...

A. Ambulatory care settings (GP, Community, Mental health, some outpatient settings):
The medication Name is normally represented by a dm+d product-code (VMP/AMP), which will include the product Strength and Form, and Route is normally not specified. Dosage is generally expressed as a single text string and should be carried in 'Dose Description'. 

B. Hospital settings (Inpatient and some outpatient settings):
The medication Name is normally represented by a dm+d code (VTM), Form and Route are normally specified explicitly  and Dosage is generally expressed as Dose / Frequency which should be carried in 'Dose Instructions' as simple text strings. 

More extensive adoption of the HSCIC Dose Syntax would allow Dose and Frequency to be captured in a more structured and computable form but this is recognised as being potentially complex to implement, at least in complete form, safely and consistently across all care settings.">

			misuse = <"This archetype has not been designed for use in an inpatient setting, other than at transitions of care to facilitate medicines reconciliation at patient transfer from/to a community setting.
