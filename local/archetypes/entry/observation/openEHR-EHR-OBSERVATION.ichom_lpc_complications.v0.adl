					comment = <"The CTCAE defines Grade 3 and 4 complications for the following categories as follows:   
Fatigue
  - Grade 1: Fatigue relieved by rest
  - Grade 2: Fatigue not relieved by rest; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Fatigue not relieved by rest, limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: N/A
Dermatitis radiation
  - Grade 1: Faint erythema or dry desquamation
  - Grade 2: Moderate to brisk erythema; patchy moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema
  - Grade 3: Moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion
  - Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site; skin graft indicated
Diarrhea
  - Grade 1: Increase of <4 stools per day over baseline; mild increase in ostomy output compared to baseline
  - Grade 2: Increase of 4 - 6 stools per day over baseline; moderate increase in ostomy output compared to baseline
  - Grade 3: Increase of >=7 stools per day over baseline; incontinence; hospitalization indicated; severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline; limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Abdominal pain
  - Grade 1: Mild pain
  - Grade 2: Moderate pain; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Severe pain; limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: N/A
Rectal mucositis
  - Grade 1: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated
  - Grade 2: Symptomatic; medical intervention indicated; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Severe symptoms; limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent operative intervention indicated
Proctitis
  - Grade 1: Rectal discomfort, intervention not indicated
  - Grade 2: Symptoms (e.g., rectal discomfort, passing blood or mucus); medical intervention indicated; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Severe symptoms; fecal urgency or stool incontinence; limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Hot flashes
  - Grade 1: Mild symptoms; intervention not indicated
  - Grade 2: Moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Severe symptoms; limiting self care ADL
  - Grade 4: N/A
Cystitis non-infective
  - Grade 1: Microscopic hematuria; minimal increase in frequency, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia; new onset of incontinence
  - Grade 2: Moderate hematuria; moderate increase in frequency, urgency, dysuria, nocturia or incontinence; urinary catheter placement or bladder irrigation indicated; limiting instrumental ADL
  - Grade 3: Gross hematuria; transfusion, IV medications or hospitalization indicated; elective endoscopic, radiologic or operative intervention indicated
  - Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent radiologic or operative intervention indicated
Urinary retention
  - Grade 1: Urinary, suprapubic or intermittent catheter placement not indicated; able to void with some residual
  - Grade 2: Placement of urinary, suprapubic or intermittent catheter placement indicated; medication indicated
  - Grade 3: Elective operative or radiologic intervention indicated; substantial loss of affected kidney function or mass
